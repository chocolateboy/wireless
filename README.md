# NAME

Wireless - a lightweight, declarative dependency-provider

# INSTALLATION

```ruby
gem "wireless"
```

# SYNOPSIS

```ruby
require "wireless"

WL = Wireless.new do
  count = 0

  # factory: return a new value every time
  on(:foo) do
    [:foo, count += 1]
  end

  # singleton: return the cached value
  once(:bar) do
    [:bar, 42]
  end

  # depend on other dependencies
  on(:baz) do |wl|
    [:baz, wl[:foo], wl[:bar]]
  end
end

# factory
WL[:foo] # [:foo, 1]
WL[:foo] # [:foo, 2]

# singleton
WL[:bar] # [:bar, 42]
WL[:bar] # [:bar, 42]

# dependencies
WL[:baz] # [:baz, [:foo, 3], [:bar, 42]]
WL[:baz] # [:baz, [:foo, 4], [:bar, 42]]

# mixin
class Example
  include WL.mixin %i[foo bar baz]

  def test
    foo # [:foo, 5]
    bar # [:bar, 42]
    baz # [:baz, [:foo, 6], [:bar, 42]]
  end
end
```

# DESCRIPTION

Wireless is a declarative dependency-provider (AKA [service locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern)),
which has the following features:

* Simplicity

    It's just an object which dependencies can be added to and retrieved from. It can
    be passed around and stored like any other object. No "injection", no containers,
    no framework, no dependencies.

* Inclusion

    Inclusion of dependency getters into a class or module with control over their visibility.

* Laziness

    As well as dependencies being resolved lazily, they can also be *registered* lazily i.e.
    at the point of creation, rather than forcing everything to be declared up-front.

* Safety

    Dependency resolution is thread-safe. Dependency cycles are checked and raise a fatal
    error as soon as they are detected.

# WHY?

## Why Wireless?

I wanted a simple service locator like [DiFtw](https://github.com/jhollinger/ruby-diftw),
with cycle detection and control over the [visibility of getters](https://github.com/jhollinger/ruby-diftw/issues/1).

## Why Service Locators?

Service locators make it easy to handle shared (AKA
[cross-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern)) dependencies i.e.
values and services that are required by multiple otherwise-unrelated parts of a system.
Examples include:

* logging
* configuration data
* storage backends
* authorisation

Rather than wiring these dependencies together manually, service locators allow them to be
registered and retrieved in a declarative way. This is similar to the difference between
imperative build tools like Ant or Gulp, and declarative build tools like Make or Rake, which
allow prerequisites to be acquired without micromanaging their construction and coordination.
